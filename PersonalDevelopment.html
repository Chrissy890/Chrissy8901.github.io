                                I have found it very important to build off of my stregths and they've helped me in various ways at school and when I'm giving a work to complete. Having such strengths
                                makes it easy to get work done efficiently and neatly. At times my stregths can also be my weakness but by maintaining self-control and using valuable reasoning then I'll
                                be back on track with the task at hand.

                                Chapter 4, titled "Achieve Your Goals", has seen Micheal and Charlie have a conversation on how to set and achieve a goal. The main process Charlie talked about was to write down
                                your goals. Firstly, You would have to think about what you want to accomplish, and writing it down will bring it to life. This is easily applicable to my life. I often have goals,
                                but I have not written them down. Thus, over time I have either not accomplished or forgotten about them. He went on to state that setting micro-goals to accomplish a long-term goal
                                will make achieving the main goal less pressuring. Chapter 5, titled "The Proper Use of Time", provides vital insight into the difference between proper time management and time management
                                trap. I have learned that whilst urgent is a matter, for now, it is not as important as following my goals as such in an urgent matter, I should also make time for goals set. In addition, the 
                                chapter teaches not achieving your goals could weigh heavily on you in your older days. Chapter 6, titled "Surround Yourself With the Best People", has brought new meaning to the Jamaican proverb
                                "You are who you associate yourself with". Charlie shared another teaching he learned from Mr.Davis about how your friends can help determine your level of success. In the chapter, various questions
                                were asked, for example, "Who am I around and what effect are they having on me?" In relation to those questions, I have to say, most of my friends are hardworking and goal-driven individuals, but I
                                have friends who are rather lazy and do not wish to work. After reading this chapter I now understand that some of my friends won't be here in the long run. We started the journey together, but we are
                                on a different path now. Chapter 7, titled "Be A Life-Long Learner", ignited a spark in me to read more.
